An environment with frames windows that consists in a client and a server that interact with the clients and servers 
so as to create a chat, its name is "ChatClient" and "ChatServer". This Java App was developed in order to help to 
teachers with software and hardware issues. When teachers had a problem with any software or hardware, they asked me 
for help by this Java App.
